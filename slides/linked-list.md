# Linked List
Solving the contiguous allocation problem


---
# What problem?
- Why is contiguous allocation bad?
- Why is it good?

.callout[
There is no single answer - your use case will drive your choice, and it will vary.
]

---
# Non-contiguous?
With an array, if we know the address of the first element, we know the address of all the rest.

PICTURE OF ARRAY WITH ADDRESSES

This is because all the elements are right next to eachother.  If we drop this requirement, then we
would need another way of knowing where *each* element is...

---
# Pointers to the rescue
What if we did this?

PICTURE OF ARRAY WITH POINTERS

.callout[
Well, this sort of solves it, but now we have an array of pointers :(
]

---
# Pointers + Data
We need to store a pointer to **next** element with each element's data.
```c++
class node {
    public:
        int data;
        node * next;
}
```
Each element in the list is now of type **`Node`**.  We c an generalize this with template syntax, so we aren't stuck with `int`s.
```c++
template <typename T>
class node {
    public:
        T data;
        node<T> * next;
}
```
---
# A chain of `node`s
Now every `node` point's to the next node... so we are in good shape - *if we just knew where the first one was*.

PICTURE WITHOUT HEAD (tail unspecified)


---
# A chain of `node`s
Now every Node point's to the next node... so we are in good shape - *if we just knew where the first one was*.

PICTURE HEAD (tail unspecified)

.callout[
We can remember where the *first* `Node` is by holding a **pointer** to it.  
]

---
# A chain of `node`s
One more problem... what should the value of `next` be in that last `node`?

PICTURE With HEAD and tail as NULL

.callout[
We can remember where the *first* `Node` is by holding a **pointer** to it.  
]
---
# Encapsulation
**Remember**, we are trying to build a *general* container class.  
- Users of a container don't want to manage `node`s
- **Instead**, we will create a class that holds a pointer to the `head`, and eventually allows a user to do all the typical list operations - **blissfully unaware of what is about to come next!**.

```c++
class List {
    public: 
        List() {
            head = NULL; // When we start, there is no first element.
        }
        ~List() { /* who wants to bet we have to clean up things here?*/ }
    private:
        node * head;
};
```

---
# Encapsulation
You might have notices that we made `node`s data members (`data` and `next`) **public**.
- You've been taught not to do this...
- However the user of a `List` object will **never** gain access to a `node` instance.
- The `List` object's public methods never return `nodes`, only data and iterators.

.callout[
There is nothing wrong with making `data` and `next` private, and providing accessors and mutators, but if the `List` is implemented correctly, not much is gained by doing this.
]
---
# List implementation
Let's start with some easy methods:
- `is_empty` - return `true` if the list is empty.
- `push_front` - add something to the front.
- `front` - return data in first element (**throw if empty**)
- `pop_front` - remove the front of list (**throw if empty**)
- `size` - return number of elements in the list.
---
# List implementation (2)
Now let's add some capabilties:
- `push_back` - add something to the back.
- `pop_back` - remove the back of list (**throw if empty**)
- `back` - return data in last element (**throw if empty**)

.callout[
To do this efficiently, we'll want to keep track of where the `tail` of the list is.
]
---
# List implementation (3)
We had a `find` method, and a `get` method in our original `ArrayList`.
- Both of these methods involved a *location*.
- Integer indexes don't make as much sense as the used to... because they don't actually tell us where the element is in memory - only pointers do.
- We do *not* return pointers - we need to return something else, that abstracts the pointer and allows access to elements in a safe way.
.callout[
**Iterators** do just this!
]

---
# Iterator implementation
An iterator encapsulates a `node`.
- Given an iterator that points to a `node`:
 - We can increment the iterator to the next location
 - We can decrement the iterator to the previous location
 - We can access (read or write) the data at the given location.

CODE FOR ITERATOR

---
# List implementation (3)
Now we can implement `get` and `find`.  We should also let users acquire an iterator:
 - Keeping with STL convention, let's provide a `begin` method to return iterator to first.

We can now traverse the list too!  We didn't overload it as completely as STL does, but at least we can call the `forward` and `is_valid` methods to move forward and stop as needed.

```c++
List<int> list;
list.push_back(5);
...
for (auto i = list.begin(); i.isValid(); i.forward()) {
    cout << i.value() << endl;
}
```

---
# List implementation (4)
Our last methods are for insert/remove from arbitrary locations.
- Again, we'll need to reference a location - an iterator.

```c++
// Add a number to the second element.
auto i = list.begin();
i.forward();            // yes, this is awkward, which is why we should
i.forward();            // override the +, +=, and ++ operator!
list.insert(i, 5);
// remove the 4th elemennt
i.forward();
i.forward();
list.remove(i);
```
.callout[
Let's think about what it takes to insert/remove from the middle of the list...
]

---
# Double-linked list
We can implement `insert` and `remove`, but it's a bit painful.
- A common alternative is to **enance** `node` to contain a `previous` pointer as well as `next`.
- This let's us easily gain a reference to **both** the `node`s neighbors.

```c++
template <typename T>
class node {
    public:
        T data;
        node<T> * next;
        node<T> * previous;
}
```

.callout[
We have to enhance the existing `List` so it sets `previous` correctly
]

---
# Iterator enhancments
- The iterator should be able to go backwards too now - `reverse`.
- In addition, we can give someone access to the `end` of the list by returning an iterator that points to `tail`

.callout[
**Warning:** STL returns an `iterator` that is "one past" the tail.  This is very useful, because it allows us to use the `end` iterator as a stopping point 
]

```c++
while (i < list.end()) {
    ...
}
```
.callout[
We aren't overloading all the operators, so we will stick with `end` pointing to `tail` - the last valid element.  **However** keep this difference in mind when using STL!
